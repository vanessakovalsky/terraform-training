# Exercise 3 - Defining and using a data source

## Goals

This exercise aims to:
* know how to define a data source
* to be able to use the data source defined in its code

## Create a Datasource

* Here is what the syntax for using the creation of a Data source looks like, which remains very similar to the syntax of a resource:
```
data "<DATA_SOURCE_NAME>" "<NAME>" {
    [CONFIG ...]
}
```
* DATA_SOURCE_NAME: corresponds to the resource on which you want to retrieve information, the list of all Data Sources is available here.
* NAME: identifier that you can use in Terraform code to refer to this data source.
* CONFIG: one or more arguments that are specific to this Data Source.
* In our example, we could for example ask Terraform to go and retrieve the information on the nginx pod
* To define our data source we can now in our terraform code, ask it to retrieve pod information:
```
data "azurerm_platform_image" "search" {
  location  = "West Europe"
  publisher = "Canonical"
  offer     = "0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy"
  sku       = "22_04-lts"
}


```
* You then retrieve the information on image you want to use for create your VM instance

## Use data from a data source

* To retrieve data from a Data source, the following attribute reference syntax is used
```
data.<DATA_SOURCE_NAME.â‰¶NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>
```
* The list of retrievable attributes is also available in the [official documentation]([https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs/data-sources/pod#spec](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/platform_image#attributes-reference))
* Here we retrieve the id of image via our data source :
```
output "image" {
  value = data.azurerm_platform_image.search.id
}
```
* Then we use the image id in our resource vm instance, just replace source_image_reference with source_image_id as below
```
resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                = "example-machine"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  size                = "Standard_F2"
  admin_username      = "adminuser"
  network_interface_ids = [
    azurerm_network_interface.example.id,
  ]

  admin_ssh_key {
    username   = "adminuser"
    public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
  }

  os_disk {
    caching              = "ReadWrite"
    storage_account_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

  source_image_id = data.azurerm_platform_image.search.id
}
```
* You must then create the configmap my-config either with kubectl or by adding the resource to the terraform files* To apply our modification, use the command: `terraform init &amp;&amp; terraform apply`
* Then return to verify with kubectl

## Delete resource
* The exercise being finished, we are going to delete the resources with the command
```
terraform destroy
```
